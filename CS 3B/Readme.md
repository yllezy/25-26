Good day!

This is your Github repository for submitting your coding activities, including your assignments, exercises and final project.

Instructions on submitting your activities:

Before submitting any activities, especially if it is your first time, please do the following:
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the repository in your local device 
3. Once cloned, navigate to your respective folder (CS 3A), and create a new folder with the name "FULL_NAME" (all caps, no spaces, _ as the delimiter), i.e. TOPE_MATEO

Every time you submit a coding activity, make sure to the following:
1. Your file name should have the TEMPLATE: LAST_NAME-ACTIVITY_NAME, i.e. (MATEO-EXERCISE_1)
2. Put the file to your respective folder.
3. Make sure that you have done the holy trinity of git, (ADD, COMMIT, PUSH)
4. Go to the forked Github link, and find the indicator that your repository is ahead of the original repository.
5. Click that to create a pull request, make sure to modify the description (i.e. This is my exercise's python notebook)
6. Once the pull request has been made, kindly notify your instructor.
7. Finally, once the PR has been accepted, evaluation is on it's way.


Please take note of the following:
1. Do not modify the repository in the organization, you need to create a forked repository.
2. Do not spam the pull requests, only one is enough, if you are not sure that the PR is on the way, inform your instructor.
3. For rejected PRs, kindly read the reason on the PR comments.
